# monopoly
Play the game of Monopoly!
This is a text based game made entirely in Python

## How to play
Keep all the files in one directory and run "GameBoard.py"

Type in the number of human and machine players, their names and start the game!

You can use several commands in the game like:

Command|Action
----|-----
*roll*| To roll the dice
*f*| To finish your turn
*ma*| To check the assets you own
*a*| To check all players' assets
*m*| To mortgage a tile
*b*| To build houses/hotels on a tile
*r*| To redeem a tile
*s*| To sell houses/hotels on a tile

## Bugs
There are several bugs in the program, and at particular points, the program doesn't run how it is expected to.

But for the most part, its playable.

If you do encounter any bugs, please tell me! I will be happy to fix them and make the game better!

## Improvements that can be made
The text printed on the console could be written better and made more relevant to a person at a particular point in the game.

Colour coding the tiles will improve player experience

## New features to add
Certain features in the original game have not been implemented. I will list a few of them. These can be implemented.

We could add graphics to the program to make it easier to play.
